# FunkinCTRL
Utility to enhance your FNF gameplay by use of Lego EV3 electric guitar.

# How to get started?

* First, assemble your EL3CTRIC GUITAR from Lego EV3 set (31313). Instruction for it can be found in programming application.
* Second, run empty infinitely-looped program on EV3 brick.
* Then start FunkinCTRL and connect to brick by selectring any of implemented method.
* Press center button on brick.

After doing all of that, open any Friday Night Funkin' song and start playing it.

* By moving slider, you can select between four inputs: left, down, up, right. Left is furthest from sensor, right is the closest.
* Press trigger to click on the arrow of needed direction.

If you feel that machine stopped responding to your inputs, restart the FunkinCTRL program. Crap happens.
